# Development

Using `grunt` to compile the stylesheets with `grunt-contrib-sass` requires you to have Ruby and Sass installed. If you're on OS X or Linux you probably already have Ruby installed; test with ruby -v in your terminal. When you've confirmed you have Ruby installed, `run gem install` sass to install Sass.
